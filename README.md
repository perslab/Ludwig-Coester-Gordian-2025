# Neural and Molecular Mediators of Acute and Long-Term Cagrilintide Effects in the Dorsal Vagal Complex

Amylin analogs, including potential anti-obesity therapies like cagrilintide, act on neurons in the brainstem dorsal vagal complex (DVC) that express calcitonin receptors (CALCR).  These receptors, often combined with receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs), mediate the suppression of food intake and body weight. To understand the molecular and neural  mechanisms of cagrilintide action we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to define 89 cell populations across the rat, mouse, and non-human primate caudal brainstem, and spatial  profiling to reveal neuron distribution in the rat DVC. Furthermore, we compared the acute  and long-term transcriptional responses to cagrilintide across DVC neurons of rats, which  exhibit strong cagrilintide responsiveness, and mice, which respond poorly to cagrilintide  over the long term. We found that cagrilintide promoted long-term transcriptional changes, including increased prolactin releasing hormone (Prlh) expression, in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) Calcr/Prlh cells in rats, but not in mice, suggesting the importance of NTS Calcr/Prlh cells for sustained weight loss. Indeed, activating rat area postrema Calcr cells briefly reduced food intake but failed to decrease food intake or body weight over the long term. In contrast, ablating NTS Prlh in the rat NTS interfered with the long-term effects of cagrilintide. Overall, these results not only provide a cross-species and spatial atlas of DVC cell populations, but also define the molecular and neural 
mediators of acute and long-term cagrilintide action
